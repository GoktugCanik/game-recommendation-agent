Description:
The Last of Us is a post-apocalypse 3rd person adventure with a distinct focus on naturalness and photorealistic graphics. It is the first title in the IP, followed by the second part, coming out in 2019 by Naughty Dog, mostly known for 'Crash Bandicoot' and 'Uncharted' series.
You play as Joel, delivering small requests in America, the year 2033, precisely 20 years after Cordyceps fungus catastrophe which have turned human hosts into infected shrooms. Your next quest is to deliver 14 years-old Ellie, immune to the virus to the hospital in the other end of a state. It is a usual story of two characters getting along throughout their journey.
You need to fight fungus infected and usual soldiers, patrolling the territory — ammo and health are of the essence here, because it is post-apocalypse and everyone is short of resources. You face multiple encounters with bosses, various traps, and numerous puzzles. Let alone the number of collectibles telling a complete story of an epidemic world.
