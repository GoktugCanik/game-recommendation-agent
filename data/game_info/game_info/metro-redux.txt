Description:
Metro 2033 Redux is a rebuilt extended version of the original post-apocalyptic first-person action shooter Metro 2033. The game saved its pace and atmosphere of the gone world and except numerous technical issues, added several survival elements to the gameplay. The main plot is based on Dmitry Glukhovsky’s book Metro 2033. According to the storyline, the Earth was devastated by the nuclear war, and only a few people were able to survive hiding in the underground warehouses. Players assume the role of Artem, 20-year-old inhabitant of Moscow underground, whose aim is to learn more about the anomalies called the Dark Ones. With the remastered version of the game developers added some visual effects: new high-quality textures, shaders, dynamic light and weather (on the surface) systems. The gameplay was also extended with various realistic features like bots’ intelligence and collectible resources count. Within the game, players face two new difficulty settings (Survival and Spartan), which are expected to improve the gaming experience.
