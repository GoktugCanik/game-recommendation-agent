Description:
Assasin's Creed IV: Black Flag is a pirate game. Being the fourth “numbered” instalment in the series, the story follows a new protagonist, Edward Kenway, who tries to build his Pirate Republic. Help legendary pirates like "Blackbeard", Charles Vane and other well-known pirates establish their empire while fighting the mystery of the Observatory - something very valuable for the Templars. Also, you will have to continue your infiltration in Abstergo and discover some new details about itself.

Although being in the Assasin's Creed series, the game provides you with some new mechanics. Giving the player full control of the ship, you will have to cross the open-world sea and fight for your piracy. Ships will be sinking, destroyed and massacred. If you prefer exploring, a whole new underwater world is ready for you with its beauty and danger lurking in the streams of Carribeans. Experience the pirate life at its best. (?) (needs a better ending)
