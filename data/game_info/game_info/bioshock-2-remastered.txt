Description:
Bioshock 2 is a shooter with RPG elements, centered around resource-management to a great extent: more like an RPG than a shooter. The game is made by 2K studios and represents the final part of a dystopia dilogy — preceded by the original Bioshock. Its successor is Bioshock Infinite.
You play as Big Daddy — a giant mech with a drill replacing one of the hands. The game, while they both are telling the story of a charming Rapture — the city descended from Orwell's and Zamyatin's pages where the society's greatest mind have suffered a severe decline.
The central feature of the game is the unique abandoned city's aesthetics — minding the time Bioshock 2 is still a beautiful title, with detailed drawn water and strange surroundings, never mind the variety of foes.
The remaster introduces a 4k resolution — it is now more enjoyable to explore Rapture and enjoy its various landscapes and sea-filled quarters. Among the other features: high-res textures and a set of Protector Trials,  which can give the player freakish weaponry and ammunition.
