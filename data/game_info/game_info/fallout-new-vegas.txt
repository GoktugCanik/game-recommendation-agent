Description:
Fallout: New Vegas is the second instalment after the reboot of the Fallout series and a fourth instalment in the franchise itself. Being a spin-off and developed by a different studio, Obsidian Entertainment, Fallout: New Vegas follows the Courier as he's ambushed by a gang lead by Benny, stealing a Platinum Chip and heavily wounded, practically left for dead. As he wakes up, he minds himself in the company of Doc Mitchell who saved our protagonist and patches him up. This section of the game is given for customising your characters, picking traits and the look of the main hero before embarking on his journey to retrieve Platinum Chip.

New Vegas has very similar gameplay to Fallout 3 with a few improvements, such as iron sights for most of the guns, new animations for VATS kills, new perk Survivor, which allowed you to have more benefits from drinks and food you could craft and gambling in the casinos. Expanded crafting system, weapon modification system force player to scavenge for resources. Reputation system was reintroduced in New Vegas as old reputation system from Fallout 2, with Karma making a serious impact on the game.
